## ü§∑ What is VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows users to send and receive data through shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Thus, applications running on an end-system (PC, smartphone, etc.) over a VPN may benefit from individual network features, protection, and management. Encryption is a standard aspect of a VPN connection but not an intrinsic one.

## üì∂ What is WireGuard?

WireGuard is a straightforward yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general-purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under a massive development, but it already might be regarded as the most secure, most comfortable to use, and the simplest VPN solution in the industry.

## Why WireGuard-Manager?

## üêõ Code Debugging

**Detailed Debugging Process After Cloning the Repository**

For a comprehensive debugging process, you might want to clone the repository to your local system. This method allows you to thoroughly test and debug the code in your environment. Follow these steps to clone the repository and start the debugging process:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the Git command to clone the repository to your preferred directory, such as `/root/` in this example. This step copies all the code from the online repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/complexorganizations/wireguard-manager /root/
```

2. **Start Debugging**: After cloning, navigate to the script's directory and initiate the debugging process. The script will be executed in debug mode, providing detailed output of each step. This output is redirected to a log file for easier examination. The log file, located in the same directory, stores all the debugging information, making it easy to trace any issues or understand the script's behavior.

```bash
bash -x /root/wireguard-manager/wireguard-manager.sh >>/root/wireguard-manager/wireguard-manager.log
```

By following these steps, you can either quickly modify the code online without cloning or perform a more comprehensive debugging process by cloning the repository to your local machine. Each method offers different benefits depending on your needs and the extent of your work with the WireGuard Manager script.

### Detailed Debugging Guide for WireGuard Manager

   - Run the script with `bash -x` to get detailed trace outputs: `bash -x /path/to/local-directory/wireguard-manager/wireguard-manager.sh >> /path/to/local-directory/wireguard-manager.log`
   - Regularly check the log file for errors or unexpected behavior.

6. **Testing in Different Environments**

   - Test the script in isolated environments like Docker containers or VMs to understand its behavior in different settings.
   - If possible, test on different operating systems to ensure compatibility.

7. **Collaborating and Seeking Feedback**

   - Commit changes to a new branch and use pull requests for reviews.
   - Request code reviews from peers to get different perspectives on potential issues.
